<h2>— history —</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The minimalism art style made way in the 60s and 70s. 
    It had been introduced in the 50s but had made its debut in homes and art museums in the 60s and 70s.
     This started to take over the abstract movement that had just taken over the years prior. 
    As it took over homes, it became the new way to decorate your homes. At first it was more artwork, then that progressed into furniture, architecture, etc. People became tired 
of the clutterness and wanted to feel clean and minimal, hence the name minimalism.</h3>

<h2>— more information —</h2>
<hr>
<h5> Minimalism art is seen as truthful, it does not hide anything, it is not overwhelming you. 
    It is exactly what it is, and does not pretend to be anything else.
Today, minimalism is all about the simplisity of it all. A design where it is not clutered or overwhelming. It is meant to calm the mind 
of any distractions and to focus on what you are seeing right in front of you. Minimalism is not always grey and dull.
Minimalism can be colorful yet simple, it walks the fine line between overwhelming and underwhelming.</h5>
